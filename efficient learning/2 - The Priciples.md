# The Principles

## Learning vs Winning the System

Notes:
In school, did you learn for grades or did you learn to gather knowledge about a topic?
Or, at work? Do you want to please your manager and/or do what the job gets done easily or do you do your work to learn new skills

school: Winning the System environment, no focus on long-term learning. Goal is to pass a test and get a good grade but mostly not to actually learn about the topic for life.

Summary: In the long-term it always pays out to learn to gain knowledge rather that winning a system by pleasing it and focusing on the allegedly requirements.

## What is Success?

What does success mean to you? Success looks different to every individual. (There are some goals that overlap and there are differences.)

Being smart alone doesn't lead to success. You need drive and persistence as well. Be a good, efficient and smart learner and be persistent and find your drive. 

There are no easy tricks to get to where you want to. You need to work hard for what you want. The easy route is for those without drive and persistence. You need to take risks and make mistakes. 
Be unconventional, take the path less travelled and have the drive and persistence.

## The Obstacle

It's frustrating to start out with something and realising, you suck at it. 
Es fühlt sich nicht gut an, zu merken, dass der Weg, bis dahin, wo man nur einfach nicht mehr "schlecht" in etwas ist, sich schon so unendlich lang anfühlt. Und dann ist man ja noch nicht einmal da! Es fühlt sich an, als könne man niemals dort ankommen.

Anstatt sich um die Hürde zu sorgen, sollte man sich denken: "Ich tue etwas, dass es wert ist, meine Zeit damit zu verbringen."
Statt mein Ego zu beschützen und wie viele andere umzudrehen, geht man weiter, man nimmt die Hürde. 

Wenn man sich überwindet und sich nicht von der Hürde abschrecken lässt, wird es eine wertvolle Lektion und ein Thema, dass es wert ist, gelernt zu werden.

Niemand ist am Anfang super. Jeder hat mal angefangen.

Fehler und Versagen lehren uns wichtige Lektionen.

## The Dip (Seth Godin)

Periods of low points
not everybody can become everything
Manchmal ist der Weg einfach nicht der richtige für dich.
Man muss wissen, wann man besser aufhört statt sich weiter über die Hürden zu quälen.

## Compound Learning 

Learning occurs every day
instead of jamming everything into our head in a short time, learn a bit every day.
"Improve by 1% a day, and in 70 days you are twice as good." - Alan Weiss
We are in this for a long run.

## Failures don't count

- against you
Jeder, der dich heute kennen lernt, erlebt dich als die Person, die du jetzt bist. Es ist egal, was früher war. Sie kennen nur dein aktuelles Ich. 
Man muss nicht immer erfolgreich sein. Meistens zählen nur die Erfolge.
Move on from successes. Don't turn back. 
If you fail, you learn something. Every failure brings you closer to where you want to be. Don't be afraid of judgement. 

## Choice vs Chore

Long term you don't keep chores/ tasks you don't enjoy.
Learning is a choice bot a chore. Choice will always beat out the chore.
You can choose to learn. Or you can choose to do nothing. Or you choose to learn for 20 minutes. But you choose. 

## It's all in the Frame

Frames change perspectives. Context. Reframing the way we think. - Get different perspective. 
E.g.: Learning is hard, I can't do it, I will never make it. vs. This is hard, but I will grow and I will be able to do it. 
beginner mindset vs beginner attitude.
I have the choice to learn every day for 20 Minutes and get where someone else already is.

Principles are there to change the mind to what you can control instead to what you have no control of.

## Pareto Principle

80/20 rule
law of vital few
roughly 80% of the results comes from 20% of the inputs
no law, no fact
not about what is this 20% but it's about eliminieren things. 100% down to 20%.
mastery = top 5%, not the best
what are the critical skills? (the 80%?) the nearer we get to the 100% the longer it takes.
Is this the best use of my time? Focus on core 20%.

## Skill Stacking (Robert Greene)

3 approaches of career strategy
1) curiosity (child like ambition to learn)
2) value learning above all else (accept a job cause you are surrounded by people you can learn from vs highest salary)
3) idea of gathering skills and combining in a unique way, get good in multiple things, create a little niche for yourself, there is always someone that is better than you in something, but stacking skills make you more valuable

have skills that work well together but varied enough to make you stand out

## Happiness Factors

find your key happiness factors
to enjoy growing and learning you need to be in a happy place
5-7 happiness factors
what are the key things that make you happy? (5-7) monitor them during your career
monitor, maintain, improve

What are your 5~7 happiness factors? Write them down, and try to monitor and check up on them every few months. I usually use a score from 1 to 5 to grade how each of my happiness factors are doing. It's very rare to have all of them at optimum 5, but it is good to monitor and be aware of their levels.
